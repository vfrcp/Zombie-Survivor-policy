    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Zombie Survivor</strong> app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Maksym Zakharchuk</strong> (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Ad Supported service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".</p>

    <h2>What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</h2>
    
    <p>The Application itself does not collect personal information directly. However, the Application uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Third-party services used by the Application:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob - for displaying advertisements</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These services may collect device identifiers, advertising IDs, and usage data to provide personalized ads. You can opt out of personalized advertising in your device settings.</p>

    <h2>Does the Application collect precise real-time location information of the device?</h2>
    
    <p>This Application does not collect precise information about the location of your mobile device.</p>

    <h2>Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?</h2>
    
    <p>The Application uses third-party advertising services (Google AdMob) that may collect and process data according to their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This data may include device identifiers and ad interaction data for serving relevant advertisements.</p>

    <h2>What are my opt-out rights?</h2>
    
    <p>You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.</p>
    
    <p>You can also opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings → Google → Ads → Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    
    <p>The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.</p>
    
    <p>The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission.</p>
    
    <p>If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider at <span class="contact-email">maksymzakharchuk8@gmail.com</span> so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.</p>
    
    <p>You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    
    <p>The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Application itself does not store any personal data. Any data collected by third-party services (AdMob) is handled according to their respective security practices.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.</p>
    
    <p class="effective-date">This privacy policy is effective as of 2026-01-04</p>

    <h2>Your Consent</h2>
    
    <p>By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the Service Provider.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    
    <p>If you have any questions regarding privacy while using the Application, or have questions about the practices, please contact the Service Provider via email at <span class="contact-email">maksymzakharchuk8@gmail.com</span>.</p>
